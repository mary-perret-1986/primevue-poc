# Vue 3 + Typescript + Vite + PrimeVue: localhost build issue reproduction

So far installing packages is good:

```bash
$ yarn
yarn install v1.22.10
warning package.json: No license field
warning package-lock.json found. Your project contains lock files generated by tools other than Yarn. It is advised not to mix 
package managers in order to avoid resolution inconsistencies caused by unsynchronized lock files. To clear this warning, remove package-lock.json.
warning my-vue-app@0.0.0: No license field
[1/4] Resolving packages...
success Already up-to-date.
Done in 0.18s.
```

Developping as well:
```
$ yarn dev
yarn run v1.22.10
warning package.json: No license field
$ vite

  vite v2.1.5 dev server running at:

  > Network:  http://192.168.0.10:3000/
  > Local:    http://localhost:3000/
  > Network:  http://172.17.128.1:3000/

  ready in 373ms.
```

That being said, if the build command below also works:
```bash
$ yarn build
yarn run v1.22.10
warning package.json: No license field
$ vite build
vite v2.1.5 building for production...

I can't find the relevant Vite options to generate a simple unified bundle:

```
.\dist\index.html
```

In the dev tools, you'll notice:
